A Fresh Standard

## Use JSONLD as replacement for CString input and stdio input for fun and profit
Today single line input is not readable enough multiline input is needed
in shells we usal archive that via the usage of the HEREDOC Syntax. 

also the nodejs or the jq tool is good for interop

## Use the WebStream format exclusiv and directly use it with the fsPromises api exclusiv
If your doing shell based stuff and or development prefer the webstream implementations
this gives us most reuseable generic code.

## FileSystems 
To Store virtual filesystems serialize Web FileSystemHandle Propertys. 
for node if needed use a Proxy. in general Proxys are a good way to abstract existing code and modules.
